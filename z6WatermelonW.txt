Ingredients:
1/2 medium watermelon (about 8 cups), peeled, seeded, and diced
1 cup of sugar
8 cups of water
1 lemon
Ice

Process to do Watermelon water:
1.-Put a cup of water on the fire, when it is hot, add the sugar and mix very well until it has dissolved perfectly well, leave it aside.
2.-This step is important, dissolving sugar in cold water takes a long time and if it doesn't dissolve well it will settle to the bottom of the jar. 
3.-In a blender, place the watermelon cubes (you may need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your blender).
4.-Add 3 cups of water and blend until the watermelon has completely dissolved in the water.
5.-Add the water with the sugar and the lemon juice.
6.-Divide and pour the watermelon, sugar, and lemon mixture into the two pitchers. Add the remaining 4 cups of water (2 per pitcher). 
7.-If you have a 4-liter jar, pot or tupperware, better.
8.-Put in the fridge and serve with lots of ice.
