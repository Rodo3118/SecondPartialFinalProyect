INGREDIENTS
1 cup of sweetened black espresso to your liking (or decaf if you prefer)
Cocoa powder to decorate
1 cup whole milk

Process:
1.-To start we put the milk in a jar with a lid or in an airtight container. 
2.-We cover well and shake vigorously for 30 seconds to a minute until the milk foams quite a lot and increases its size a lot.
3.-That is the quick resource but you can do this process in a blender for 2 min and the result will be even more foamy.
4.-Immediately put the already whipped milk in the microwave for about 30 seconds and thus the foam is compacted. 
5.-If you used an airtight container or jar, use that for the microwave as well.
6.-We first put this thick milk foam in the serving cup and carefully pour the sweetened coffee on the side. 
7.-In this way the coffee goes down and the foam stays up. Decorate by sprinkling with cocoa powder and serve immediately, very hot.
8.-Enjoy your Capuccino!
