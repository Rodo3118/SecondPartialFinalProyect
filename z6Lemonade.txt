Ingredients:
4 lemons.
80 gr of sugar (you can really use the sweetener you prefer and in the amount you like the most, but that's how I prepare it).
500 gr of ice cubes.
500 ml of water.

Process:
1.-Completely peel the 4 lemons so that only the segments remain, without the white part or the skin. Also remove all the nuggets that you can.
2.-Put the lemons in the blender glass, and add half of the water (about 250 gr).
3.-Blend it all until you have a paste. We have used our glass blender and in 30 seconds we already had everything well crushed.
4.-Pour the mixture into a strainer and strain it. There are those who prefer not to strain it, but I assure you that it is much better strained since there is always some nugget and remains of skin, and when you drink it you can tell.
5.-Rinse the blender jar, pour the strained mixture into it, and add the rest of the water, the cubes and the sugar. Crush everything again until the cubes have practically broken down, and you have it ready.
